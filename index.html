                <p>For Germany, the criticism of religion has been essentially completed, and the criticism of religion is the prerequisite of all criticism.
                The profane existence of error is compromised as soon as its heavenly oratio pro aris et focis [“speech for the altars and hearths,” i.e., for God and country] has been refuted. Man, who has found only the reflection of himself in the fantastic reality of heaven, where he sought a superman, will no longer feel disposed to find the mere appearance of himself, the non-man [Unmensch], where he seeks and must seek his true reality.</p>
                <p>The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.
                Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.</p>

                <p>Chen Shih-yin, in a vision, apprehends perception and spirituality. Chia Yue-
                ts'un, in the (windy and dusty) world, cherishes fond thoughts of a beautiful maiden.
                This is the opening section; this the first chapter. Subsequent to the visions of a
                dream which he had, on some previous occasion, experienced, the writer
                personally relates, he designedly concealed the true circumstances, and borrowed
                the attributes of perception and spirituality to relate this story of the Record of
                the Stone. With this purpose, he made use of such designations as Chen Shih-yin
                (truth under the garb of fiction) and the like. What are, however, the events
                recorded in this work? Who are the dramatis personae?</p>
                <p>Wearied with the drudgery experienced of late in the world, the author
                speaking for himself, goes on to explain, with the lack of success which
                attended every single concern, I suddenly bethought myself of the womankind
                of past ages. Passing one by one under a minute scrutiny, I felt that in action
                and in lore, one and all were far above me; that in spite of the majesty of my
                manliness, I could not, in point of fact, compare with these characters of the
                gentle sex. And my shame forsooth then knew no bounds; while regret, on the
                other hand, was of no avail, as there was not even a remote possibility of a day
                of remedy.</p>
